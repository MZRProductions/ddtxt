@james and @brandon are spending some quality time together on a national holiday during the summer. However, they discover a strange realm where they gain magic powers. What happens when they realize that they must attend the picky neighbor's cookout? (Probably not much, but you won't know until you've read it.)

// BEGINNING OF CHAPTERS


<chapter>

name = Introduction
subtitle = none

<text>

@james walked over to the stove and grabbed the pot, moving it over to the other side of the stove, which was much cooler. @brandon was supposed to be coming, but < was slightly late. @james put out several bowls of snacks on the counter. After the bowls were arranged, @james put soda on the end. Finally, @james moved the pot of cheese dip to a wooden trivet.

(break)

There was a sound coming from the driveway. Within a few seconds, the doorbell rang. @james ran over to door and opened it to greet @brandon.

[james: Hello!]

[brandon: Hi, @james.]

[james: The food is ready. Come inside!]

@brandon walked inside and took = sunglasses off. The living room was pretty dark, even with the kitchen light coming through.

[james: Let's open the curtains. It's too dark.]

Opening the curtains up let sunbeams loose that rode the living room's dust down to the floor.

[brandon: That's better. I brought a movie for us to watch.]

[james: What is it?]

[brandon: Exploding Car Action 2!]

[james: Ah..]

Fake excitement was never +james strength.

[brandon: I also brought a frisbee for us to play with.]

[james: Oh! That sounds like fun. It's such a nice day.]

[brandon: Let's eat a snack, and then we can throw the frisbee back and forth for a bit.]

</text>

<chapter>

name = A Snack
subtitle = (It's really that simple.)

<text>

They went to the kitchen where @james grabbed a couple plates.

[james: I got the good pretzels. I know you really like those.]

[brandon: They have a much better crunch.]

@james got mostly chips and cheese dip, whereas @brandon got more pretzels than chips. However, they both got plenty of cheese dip. They both walked back to the living room so that they could eat their food.

// Remember character reference shorthand:
[: I'm so happy that you found this dip recipe.]

[james: I am too.]

The crunch of the chips with the warm, cheesy dip was wonderful. Combined with the comfortable sofa, it was superb.

[brandon: (crunch)]

[james: (burp)(em dash)Oh!]

[brandon: Hah.]

[: I bet that felt good.]

[james: It did...]

They were halfway finished with their snacks. @brandon had eaten most of = chips, leaving only pretzels.

[brandon: They never have pretzels at work.]

[james: At least you get snacks at work. (crunch)]

[brandon: They never give me enough time to eat the snacks.]

[: What's the point if I can't eat them? (munch)]

[james: It's not like it's your money being wasted.]

They were almost done now. @james was getting comfortable sitting on the sofa. @ shifted to avoid getting stuck to the sofa. @brandon had finished = pretzels and dip, so < set = plate down on the seat between them.

[: You're done already? There's plenty more.]

[brandon: I'll save it for later.]

</text>

</chapter>

<chapter>

name = Frisbee
subtitle = (It postpones the movie...)

<text>

They got up (slowly) from the sofa and @james took both plates to the kitchen sink. @brandon spoke from the living room.

[brandon: I'm going to go get the frisbee.]

[james: Ok. I'll meet you outside.]

@james walked out to the back porch through the back door in the dining room. The back porch was nice for the size of the house. The backyard was equally luxurious for the price of the house. It was a great find.

(break)

The house bordered a light forest and a creek that ran alongside much of the neighborhood. This was much of the reason @james moved here, although it meant that the house was at a greater risk of flooding. It was always something.

(break)

@brandon opened the door, lowering = sunglasses.

[brandon: Here, take this. (throw)]

< threw the frisbee to @james, who was only standing a few feet away. Upon inspecting the frisbee, @ saw that it was a similar shade of blue to +brandon hair color. It also had a design featuring the wavy spikes of hair that they all had.
// They all have hair spikes coming out of the back of their heads.
// Brandon has blue hair and James has yellowish-orange hair.
$ It was typical for @brandon to have silly egotistical merchandise made from = "personality." After all, = associates had to milk every bit of celebrity status < had.

[james: What is this?]

[brandon: They had too many left in the warehouse.]

[: I have boxes of them in my garage.]

[james: People buy this stuff?]

[brandon: Of course they do! They love me.]

@ had now backed up far enough for another throw. @james threw the frisbee to @brandon, going a bit too far to the left. The wind did not hinder much, apart from the occasional gust. @ threw back to the porch steps, which @james was gradually descending. (@ didn't want the frisbee to break the porch.)

[james: Let's head to the back!]

[brandon: OK.]

=brandon voice was already quieter than normal due to the distance between them. @james threw the frisbee to the back of the yard, making @brandon chase after it.

[brandon: Ah!]

[james: (laugh)]

As @james ran to catch up with >brandon, < threw it further back, making @james run too. Barely catching it, @ tried to curve the frisbee toward @brandon normally, but a wind gust sent the frisbee toward the forest.

[brandon: I'll get it.]

< started walking toward the runaway frisbee, but before the frisbee landed, there was a crackly, raspy sound and a blinding ripple of light coming from the frisbee's location.

[brandon: Look!]

[james: It's so beautiful.]

There was an undulating, amorphous cloud of colorful light.

[brandon: What the hell is that?]

@james felt the urge to walk closer. @brandon ran back to bring @james closer. Within a few seconds, they were both standing close to the light.

[james: What if it's radioactive?]

[brandon: We'll be okay. I bet it's not THAT radioactive.]

The light show was hypnotic and soothing. It made them want to come closer, and closer(em dash)and closer.

[brandon: Let's go into it.]

[james: It must be irresponsible, but it's so pretty.]

[brandon: Let's go.]

// Brandon and James get their powers.

// Brandon can slow down his experience of external time (based on the pace of his heartbeat) while keeping his body running at a normal speed. This disparity, or time dilation, makes him appear to speed up. However, this greatly exerts his energy exponentially based on said time disparity. (He can't keep it up forever.) I would also assume that other, external forces would become weaker (based on a lower passage of time) such as gravity, meaning that he could perhaps jump higher?

// James grows wings and can fly. This power is inherently more externally visible and noticeable than Brandon's.

Violent swells of colorful light and sound enveloped them as they were crudely forced and
// (Dropkicking is when you drop something over or near your foot and then kick it before it reaches the ground.)
$ dropkicked through dimensions.

// My standard for multiple characters speaking at once is to use a comma separated list.
// [##X, Y, and Z: ]
// If only two characters are speaking, then you would only need "and" between the names.
// [##X and Y: ]

// (We use two hashtags to specify the literal symbol.)
[##Brandon and James: AAHH!]

There was either no gravity or as much gravity as they could feel. It mattered very little in that instant. Their livelihood was only tethered to that day by their current flipbook of flight.

[brandon: Don't let go of my hand!!]

[james: (silence)]

[brandon: Alright!?]

[james: O(em dash)...k-ay..!]

[ida: Hello, world!]

[emily: Hello, world!]

[frank: Hello, world!]

// Future writing plans:

// After they both get powers, they get really hungry and sick for a night (as their powers develop), which means that they sleep in till really late the following morning.

// They wake up to the doorbell ringing. It's James' neighbor, Emily, reminding James of the cookout later that day.

// At some point, Brandon discovers his powers by running to save James from a temporary boom in the bonfire.
